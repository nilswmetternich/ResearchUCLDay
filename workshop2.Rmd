Please discuss in your group:

1. What aspects of my research are potentially most impactful?
2. What current belief/practice/policy is my research challenging?
3. How could my research contribute to changing that current belief/practice/policy?
4. Which stakeholders are crucial in this change?
5. Are there opportunities for knowledge co-production?
5. How and who within UCL can help my research to achieve the impact I would like my research to make?
